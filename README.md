# CryptoChords
CryptoChords is a tool for visualizing activities on the [Hemi network](https://hemi.xyz). It features a web application that enables users to explore the network and visualize transactions in a user-friendly manner.

This document provides instructions on how to set up, run, and contribute to the project.

## Visual Representation of the Network
CryptoChords provides a visual representation of the Hemi network using a piano keyboard as a metaphor. Every time a new transaction is added to the network, a cube appears on a piano key, representing the transaction. The transaction details are displayed on the screen, and if sound is enabled, the corresponding piano note is played simultaneously.

There are four types of transactions, each represented by a different color and associated with a different quadrant of the piano keyboard:

- **Green**: Hemi block creation
- **Blue**: Ethereum transaction
- **Orange**: Bitcoin transaction
- **Purple**: Pop Miner transaction

A random key within the corresponding quadrant is selected to represent each transaction.


## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- `apps`: Contains the API and the Web application.
- `packages`: Contains the components shared between the apps.
- `infrastucture`: Contains the necessary files to deploy the project.

## Architecture
This project is a monorepo composed of two applications: the API and the Web application and it is managed by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

Both the API and the Web application follow the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. You can find more information about the architecture in the `readme.md` file of each project.
